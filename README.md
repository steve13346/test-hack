(if you want to skip this step, go to step 5 and leave the discordWebhook in config.json as it is)


### Step 5
Put in the desired limiteds in limiteds.txt and seperate them with a comma.
It should look like this
Asset1, Asset2, Asset3
You can also just put the ID if you want to do 1

That's all, hope you get some good deals and some good robux, if you do make sure to star this repository.
